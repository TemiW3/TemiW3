- 🦾 Exploring **Rust** and the **Solana ecosystem** through a 6-week bootcamp
- 🧱 Contributing to open source Web3 projects and hackathons

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Solidity, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- **Smart Contract Tooling:** Foundry, Hardhat, Anchor
- **Test Automation:** Playwright, Cypress, Postman, REST APIs
- **Other:** GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Git, Docker

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced Solidity patterns and gas optimization
- Anchor framework + building Solana programs
- Account Abstraction on Ethereum
